    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chocolate Chia Seed Pudding</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup cacao powder or unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>3-5 Tbsp maple syrup</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 pinch sea salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups Almond Breeze Almondmilk Original Unsweetened (or light coconut milk for creamier texture!)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chia seeds</li>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <h5>Step 1</h5>
        <li>To a small mixing bowl add cacao powder (sift first to reduce clumps), maple syrup, ground cinnamon, salt, and vanilla and whisk to combine. Then add a little dairy-free milk at a time and whisk until a paste forms. Then add remaining dairy-free milk and whisk until smooth.</li>
        <h5>Step 2</h5>
        <li>Add chia seeds and whisk once more to combine. Then cover and refrigerate overnight, or at least 3-5 hours (until itâ€™s achieved a pudding-like consistency). It may also be helpful to give the mixture an extra whisk/stir once it has been in the refrigerator for 30-45 minutes.</li>
        <h5>Step 3</h5>
        <li>Leftovers keep covered in the fridge for 4-5 days, though best when fresh. Serve chilled with desired toppings, such as fruit, granola, or coconut whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>
