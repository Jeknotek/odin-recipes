    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The easiest banana oatmeal pancakes made right in the blender! These fluffy healthy pancakes are naturally gluten free, dairy free and contain no flour or added sugar. Get ready for a simple yet delicious breakfast!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Bananas: super ripe bananas give the pancakes their natural sweetness. Make sure they have lots of brown spots!</li>
        <li>Eggs: you’ll need 2 eggs</li>
        <li>Milk: add moisture with any milk you’d like. I typically use unsweetened almond milk.</li>
        <li>Oats</li>
        <li>Cinnamon</li>
        <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>Baking Power: To add the fluffy.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <h5>Step 1</h5>
        <li>Blend the ingredients. Yes, you’ll literally add all of the ingredients to a blender, and blend on high until smooth!</li>
        <h5>Step 2</h5>
        <li>Let batter sit. You’ll then want to let the batter sit in your blender for about 2 minutes while you heat up your pan.</li>
        <h5>Step 3</h5>
        <li>Cook & flip. Add olive oil or coconut oil to a griddle or large nonstick pan and place over medium heat. Add pancake batter 1/3 cup at a time and cook for about 2-3 minutes or until golden brown and tiny bubbles appear around the edges. Flip and cook 2 minutes more.</li>
        <h5>Step 4</h5>
        <li>Serve & devour. Serve pancakes with fresh fruit and a drizzle of pure maple syrup if you’d like!</li>
    </ol>
